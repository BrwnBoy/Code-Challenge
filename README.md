## How to get to the Programs:

First copy the SSH key so that you can be able to clone the repository to you local machine. After cloning the repository to your machine **cd** into it so that we can be able to open it through our personal editors(**VS code**). From there; you can now begin to make your own personal tweaks in the programs.

*Happy Coding!*

### What each of the Programs contain:

This Repository contains three individual programs with Javascript codes for the specificed challenges:
**Index.html**: This program is where all the connecting is done through;(*linking the js programs to the html*), making it possible for the form to receive output since the coding for the activities are pulled from the Javascript Indexes.

**Index-1**: This program propmts the user to input students marks, and then check the grade based on the marks inputed. The grade is then outputted to the console.

**Index-2**: This program defines the speed limit and prompts the user to input the car speed. It then calculates the number of demerits points based on the difference between the car speed and the speed limit. if the number of demerit points exceeds 12, the program prints **"License suspended"**. Otherwise, it prints the number of demrits points.

**Index-3**: This program prompts the user to input the basic salary and benefits, and then calculates the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary. The results are then outputted to the console.
